\title{A Sample Document With LabPal Data}
\author{Fred Flintstone}
\maketitle

\input{labpal-tables.tex}
\input{labpal-plots.tex}

This is a simple \LaTeX{} document showing how to include plots, macros and
tables generated with LabPal inside your research paper. Our paper will use the
data generated by the \emph{Sorting Lab} example contained in LabPal's example
folder.

\section*{Required Packages}

Make sure your \LaTeX{} file imports the following packages:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{graphicx} and \texttt{pdfpages} to include figures
\item \texttt{multirow} for tables
\item \texttt{hyperref} for the hyperlink functionalities
\end{itemize}

\section*{Importing the Files}

The first step is to run the experiments in the lab, and to export three files:

\begin{itemize}
\item The PDF files for all plots in the lab. Go to the \textsl{Plots} page and
click on the ``Download all plots'' button. By default, the file is called
\verb+labpal-plots.pdf+.
\item The macro file to easily import the plots. In the \textsl{Plots} page,
click on the ``Download \LaTeX{} macros'' button. By default, the file is called
\verb+labpal-plots.tex+.
\item The \LaTeX{} file for the tables. In the \textsl{Tables} page, click on
the ``Download all tables'' button. By default, the file is called
\verb+labpal-tables.tex+.
\end{itemize}

Copy these three files in the same folder as your research paper. At the top
of the paper, make sure you include the two \texttt{.tex} files using the \texttt{input}
command.

\section*{Adding a Table}

To add a table to your text, create a \texttt{table} environment as usual. Use
the command \verb+\usebox{\boxname}+ to include the contents of a table, where
\verb+boxname+ is the name of one of the boxes defined in
\verb+labpal-tables.tex+. (In your lab, you can set the name given to each
table's box through method \verb+setNickname()+. Otherwise, LabPal assigns a
default name to each table.)

\begin{table}
\centering
\usebox{\sorttime}
\caption{This table is generated by LabPal. Hyperlinks in the table refer to
individual data points in the lab.}
\label{table-sort}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table-sort} shows an example of a table included in such a way. Each
cell in the table is a hyperlink. The destination of each link can be
copy-pasted in LabPal's web console, in the \textsl{Find} page, which takes you
to the table, plot or macro where this specific data point is defined.

\section*{Adding a Plot}

Adding a plot can be done in the same way as a table; create a \texttt{figure}
environment, and use the \verb+\usebox{\boxname}+ to include a specific image;
\verb+boxname+ is the name of one of the boxes defined in
\verb+labpal-plots.tex+.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\usebox{\sortplot}
\caption{This plot is generated by LabPal. The hyperlink points to the same
figure inside the lab instance.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{table-sort} shows an example of a figure included in such a way. The
figure is surrounded by a hyperlink. The destination of this link can be
copy-pasted in LabPal's web console, in the \textsl{Find} page, which takes you
to the plot and its associated data table.
