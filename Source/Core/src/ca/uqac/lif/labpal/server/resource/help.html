<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>Welcome to LabPal, a versatile environment for running experiments on
a computer.</p>

<p>You are currently using the web interface that belongs to a
<strong>laboratory</strong> (or <i>lab</i> for short). A lab contains
a set of <a href="/experiments"><strong>experiments</strong></a>.
When an experiment is executed,
it produces one or many <strong>output parameters</strong>, whose data
may be used to create <a href="/tables"><strong>tables</strong></a>, 
<a href="/plots"><strong>plots</strong></a> and 
<a href="/macros"><strong>macros</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The execution of the experiments is managed by a
<a href="/assistant"><strong>lab
assistant</strong></a>. Typically, one views the list of experiments,
picks some of them and adds them to the assistant's <em>queue</em>. One
can then start/stop the assistant at any time, and view the status of
completed experiments and plots.</p>

<p>At any moment, the current status of the lab (complete with any data
produced by experiments that are finished) can be saved to a file. The
reverse operation is also possible: one can (up)load a saved file and
resume the execution of the lab from that point.</p>

<p>These are the basic rules for using LabPal. If the author of this
specific lab has written a description, you can read it in the
<a href="/index">home page</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about using LabPal, please refer to its
<a href="https://liflab.github.io/labpal">web site</a>, which includes
an extensive user manual and tutorial videos.</p>
